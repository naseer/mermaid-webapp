mermaid-webapp
===============

This is a simple angular webapp allowing for creation of graphs and sequence diagrams on the web
Uses [mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) and [angularjs](https://angularjs.org/)

Thanks to Knut Sveidqvis (@knsv) for creating the mermaid project!

I also referred to https://github.com/kmader/angular-mermaid-js by @kmader to integrate this with angular.

For styling, the [materializecss](http://materializecss.com/) framework was used.
